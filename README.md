# PetFriendFinder

Project Description 

Lonely at the dog park? Need a play date with your pet? Or maybe your pet needs to learn to socialize?
This application will help find a pet that has similar behaviors and personality traits to yours. Take a survey to match your pet with others by comparing your entered score within the database of other pets' ratings. This will also add your pet to the list in the application, then hopefully you'll see if more matches come your way, too. We're here to help you and your pet find a friend.

To USE:
Write up data for your potential matches with JSON formatting. Add the user's input to the data for future match-ups by others. Run a loop and inner loop over the data to match the closest scores then come up with the best score at the end. Set up your front-end with a way for the user to answer questions that Javascript will add up and send back for processing and displaying your match with a modal pop-up.
